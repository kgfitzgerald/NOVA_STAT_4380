This repository houses all the public material that is linked to on the Villanova STAT 4380 course website (https://nova-stat-4380.netlify.app/schedule/), such as lab assignments, slides, etc. Each assignment / slide document / course page is powered by an Rmarkdown file (.Rmd) that renders to an .html file. The repository uses GitHub Pages so that each .html file is publicly accessible via a URL. For example, the file week-01.html in the folder ae is available at the URL https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/NOVA_STAT_4380/ae/week-01.html. These links are placed in the data/schedule.yaml and/or data/schedule2.yaml files in the STAT_4380_website repository (https://github.com/kgfitzgerald/STAT_4380_website) to power the tables in the Schedule tab of the website.
