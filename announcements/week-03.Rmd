### Questions?

+ See Perusall for answers to your questions! 

    + all answered as of 8pm Monday
    + others will be answered later this week
    + follow up in class or on Piazza if urgent!

*What's the difference between the `fill` and `color` aesthetics in `ggplot`?*

-   For histograms / things with bars, `color` = outside, `fill` = inside.

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = "blue")

ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = "blue", fill = "red")
```

-   For points, use `color`

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(x = area, y = poptotal, 
                    color = state)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note how the above examples set `color` inside or outside `aes()` in the global `ggplot()` layer.

-   Put inside `aes()` if you want to map a variable in the data to the color/fill
-   Put outside `aes()`, usually in the `geom_` layer, if you want to set `color/fill` to a specific color for the whole plot
-   Later layers will override earlier layers

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(x = area, y = poptotal, 
                    color = state)) +
  geom_point(color = "pink")
```

### Application Exercise

-   The remainder of class will be spent on AE-03.
-   You can access it from GitHub.
-   It is due at the end of class today.
-   To turn it in, you should upload your .html file to Blackboard.
