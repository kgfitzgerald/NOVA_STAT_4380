# Getting started with R & RStudio

To get fully set-up for using R & RStudio, there are 4 main steps:

1. Download & Install R
2. Download & Install RStudio
3. Set up an R project for STAT 4380
4. Install packages

The instructions below will walk you through each step. **You should do these BEFORE our Thursday class session, since we will be diving into coding together in class.**

### Step 1: Download & Install R

Navigate to [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) and then:

+ If you are a Windows user: Click on "Download R for Windows", then click on "base", then click on the Download link.
+ If you are macOS user: Click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X", then under "Latest release:" click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of January 2026 was R-4.5.2. Note there are different links for Silicon vs Intel Macs (check your "About This Mac" to know which one you have).

Open the downloaded file and follow your computer's instructions for installing the software. 

### Step 2 - Download & Install RStudio

Navigate to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to download & install RStudio. We will be using the RStudio Desktop FREE version.

+ Click on the download link corresponding to your computer's operating system
+ Open the download file and follow your computer's instructions for installing the software. For Mac users, begin the installation process by dragging the RStudio icon (right) into the Applications folder (left)
