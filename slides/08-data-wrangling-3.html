# Goals

Today we will practice: 

+ pivoting data frames to wide or long format
+ planning a data wrangling pipeline to accomplished a desired task/visualization
+ computing (conditional) proportions using `dplyr` verbs

# Case study: Grocery sales

---

## Grocery sales

- Have:
  &lt;!-- - Purchases: One row per customer per item, listing purchases they made --&gt;
  - Customers: one row per customer, and a column for each item they purchased
  - Prices: one row per item in the store, listing their prices
- Want: one row per customer per item
  - How much revenue was brought in per item (e.g. milk)? 
  - How much was spent per person? 
  - How much total revenue was brought into the store?

The goal of tidyr is to help you tidy your data via

- pivoting for going between wide and long data
- splitting and combining character columns
- nesting and unnesting columns
- clarifying how `NA`s should be treated

## Case study: The Titanic

We will consider three categorical variables in particular: `survived`, `sex`, and `class`. 


``` r
titanic_df &lt;- titanic::titanic_train |&gt;
  select(
    survived = Survived,
    sex      = Sex,
    class    = Pclass
  ) |&gt;
  mutate(
    survived = if_else(survived == 1, "Survived", "Died"),
    class    = factor(class, labels = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd"))
  )

glimpse(titanic_df)
```

```

## $ sex      &lt;chr&gt; "male", "female", "female", "female", "male", …
## $ class    &lt;fct&gt; 3rd, 1st, 3rd, 1st, 3rd, 3rd, 1st, 3rd, 3rd, 2…
```

---

## What does group_by() do?

`group_by()` takes an existing data frame and converts it into a grouped data frame where subsequent operations are performed "once per group"

.pull-left[

``` r
titanic_df
```

```
##     survived    sex class
## 1       Died   male   3rd
## 2   Survived female   1st
## 3   Survived female   3rd
## 4   Survived female   1st

## What does group_by() not do?

`group_by()` does not create frequency tables, `count()` does

## count() is a short-hand

`count()` is a short-hand for `group_by()` and then `summarise()` to count the number of observations in each group

.pull-left[

  group_by(sex) |&gt;
  summarise(n = n())
