## Data

- Family income and gift aid data from a random sample of fifty students in the freshman class of Elmhurst College in Illinois, USA
- Gift aid is financial aid that does not need to be paid back, as opposed to a loan

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
ggplot(elmhurst, aes(x = family_income, y = gift_aid)) +
  geom_point(color = "#8E2C90", size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(suffix = "K")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(suffix = "K")) +
  labs(
    x = "Family income",
    y = "Gift aid",
    title = "Gift aid and family income",
    subtitle = "Random sample 50 students at Elmhurst College"
  )
```

The data come from the openintro package: [`elmhurst`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/elmhurst.html).

## Linear model

.pull-left[
.small[
```{r}
lm(gift_aid ~ family_income, data = elmhurst) |>
  tidy()
```
]
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot(elmhurst, aes(x = family_income, y = gift_aid)) +
  geom_point(color = "#8E2C90", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#8E2C90") +

## Interpreting the slope

.pull-left-wide[
```{r elmhurst-fit, echo=FALSE}
lm(gift_aid ~ family_income, data = elmhurst) |>
  tidy()
```
]
.pull-right-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot(elmhurst, aes(x = family_income, y = gift_aid)) +
  geom_point(color = "#8E2C90", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#8E2C90") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(suffix = "K")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(suffix = "K")) +
  labs(
    x = "Family income",
    y = "Gift aid",
    title = "Gift aid and family income",
    subtitle = "Random sample 50 students at Elmhurst College"
  )
```
]

For each additional $1,000 of family income, we would expect students to receive a net difference of 1,000 * (-0.0431) = -$43.10 in aid on average, i.e. $43.10 less in gift aid, on average.

# Inference

---

## Statistical inference 

... is the process of using sample data to make conclusions about the underlying population the sample came from

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/photo-1571942676516-bcab84649e44.png")
```

---

## Estimation

So far we have done lots of estimation (mean, median, slope, etc.), i.e.
- used data from samples to calculate sample statistics
- which can then be used as estimates for population parameters

.question[
If you want to estimate a population parameter, do you prefer to report a range of values the parameter might be in, or a single value?
]

<br>

--

- If we report a point estimate, we probably won’t hit the exact population parameter
- If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter

# Confidence intervals

## Confidence intervals

A plausible range of values for the population parameter is a **confidence interval**.

--
- In order to construct a confidence interval we need to quantify the variability of our sample statistic

--
- For example, if we want to construct a confidence interval for a population slope, we need to come up with a plausible range of values around our observed sample slope

--
- This range will depend on how precise and how accurate our sample slope is as an estimate of the population slope

--
- Quantifying this requires a measurement of how much we would expect the sample statistic to vary from sample to sample

.question[
Suppose we split the class in half down the middle of the classroom and ask each student their heights. Then, we calculate the mean height of students on each side of the classroom. Would you expect these two means to be exactly equal, close but not equal, or wildly different?

.question[
Suppose you randomly sample 50 students and 5 of them are left handed. If you were to take another random sample of 50 students, how many would you expect to be left handed? Would you be surprised if only 3 of them were left handed? Would you be surprised if 40 of them were left handed?

## Quantifying the variability of slopes

We can quantify the variability of sample statistics using the Central Limit Theorem!

$$b_1 \approx N(\beta_1, SE(b_1))$$
$$b_1 \sim t(df = n-p)$$

---

## 95% confidence interval

Approximately:
$$b_1 \pm 2*SE(b_1)$$
Exactly: 
$$b_1 \pm t_{1-\alpha/2, n - p}*SE(b_1)$$
Example: 

$\alpha = 0.05$, $p = 2$ (1 intercept + 1 predictor)

```{r}
qt(.975, nrow(elmhurst) - 2)

```

---

## 95% confidence interval

```{r}
m1 <- lm(gift_aid ~ family_income, data = elmhurst)
tidy(m1)
confint(m1)
```


---

## Interpreting the slope, take two

```{r echo=FALSE}
#int_pctl(elmhurst_models, coef_info)
```

**We are 95% confident that** for each additional $1,000 of family income, we would expect students to receive $`r round(abs(confint(m1)[2,1])*1000,2)` to $`r round(abs(confint(m1)[2,2])*1000,2)` less in gift aid, on average.


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

```
