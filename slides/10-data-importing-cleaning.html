# Why should you care about data types?

---

## Example: Cat lovers

A survey asked respondents their name and number of cats. The instructions said to enter the number of cats as a numerical value.


``` r
cat_lovers &lt;- read_csv("data/cat-lovers.csv")
```


```
## # A tibble: 60 × 3
##   name           number_of_cats handedness
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;     
## 1 Bernice Warren 0              left      
## 2 Woodrow Stone  0              left      
## 3 Willie Bass    1              left      
## 4 Tyrone Estrada 3              left      
## 5 Alex Daniels   3              left      
## 6 Jane Bates     2              left      
## # ℹ 54 more rows
```

## Oh why won't you work?!


``` r
cat_lovers |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

```
## Warning: There was 1 warning in `summarise()`.
## ℹ In argument: `mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats)`.
## Caused by warning in `mean.default()`:

```

```
## Warning: There was 1 warning in `summarise()`.

## Take a breath and look at your data

.question[
What is the type of the `number_of_cats` variable?
]


``` r
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

```
## Rows: 60
## Columns: 3
## $ name           &lt;chr&gt; "Bernice Warren", "Woodrow Stone", "Will…
## $ number_of_cats &lt;chr&gt; "0", "0", "1", "3", "3", "2", "1", "1", …

## Sometimes you might need to babysit your respondents

.midi[

``` r

  mutate(number_of_cats = case_when(
    name == "Ginger Clark" ~ 2, #if name is Ginger Clark, assign value 2
    name == "Doug Bass"    ~ 3, #if names is Doug Bass, assign value 3
    TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats #else, keep original value
    )) |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```
]

--

Error in `mutate()`:
ℹ In argument: `number_of_cats = case_when(...)`.
Caused by error in `case_when()`:

---

## Always you need to respect data types


``` r
cat_lovers |&gt;
  mutate(number_of_cats = case_when(
    name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2", #if name is Ginger Clark, assign value 2
    name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3", #if names is Doug Bass, assign value 3
    TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats #else, keep original value

    ) |&gt;
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   mean_cats
##       &lt;dbl&gt;

```

---

## Now that we know what we're doing...


``` r
*cat_lovers &lt;- cat_lovers |&gt;
  mutate(
    number_of_cats = case_when(
      name == "Ginger Clark" ~ "2",
      name == "Doug Bass"    ~ "3",
      TRUE                   ~ number_of_cats

    )

cat_lovers |&gt; 
  summarise(mean_cats = mean(number_of_cats))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   mean_cats
##       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.833
```

---

## Moral of the story

- If your data does not behave how you expect it to, type coercion upon reading in the data might be the reason.
- Go in and investigate your data, apply the fix, *save your data*, live happily ever after.

# Data types

---

## Data types in R

- **logical**
- **double**
- **integer**
- **character**
- and some more, but we won't be focusing on those

---

## Logical &amp; character

.pull-left[
**logical** - boolean values `TRUE` and `FALSE`


``` r
typeof(TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```
]
.pull-right[
**character** - character strings


``` r
typeof("hello")
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]

---

## Double &amp; integer

.pull-left[
**double** - floating point numerical values (default numerical type)


``` r
typeof(1.335)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

``` r
typeof(7)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```
]
.pull-right[
**integer** - integer numerical values (indicated with an `L`)


``` r
typeof(7L)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

``` r
typeof(1:3)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```
]

---

## Converting between types

.hand[with intention...]

.pull-left[

``` r
x &lt;- 1:3
x
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

``` r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```
]
--
.pull-right[

``` r
y &lt;- as.character(x)
y
```

```
## [1] "1" "2" "3"
```

``` r
typeof(y)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```
]

---

## Converting between types

.hand[with intention...]

.pull-left[

``` r
x &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)
x
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

``` r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```
]
--
.pull-right[

``` r
y &lt;- as.numeric(x)
y
```

```
## [1] 1 0
```

``` r
typeof(y)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```
]

---

## Converting between types

.hand[without intention...]

R will happily convert between various types without complaint when different types of data are concatenated in a vector, and that's not always a great thing!

.pull-left[

``` r
c(1, "Hello")
```

```
## [1] "1"     "Hello"
```

``` r
c(FALSE, 3L)
```

```
## [1] 0 3
```
]
--
.pull-right[

``` r
c(1.2, 3L)
```

```
## [1] 1.2 3.0
```

``` r
c(2L, "two")
```

```
## [1] "2"   "two"
```
]

---

## Explicit vs. implicit coercion

Let's give formal names to what we've seen so far:

--
- **Explicit coercion** is when you call a function like `as.logical()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.integer()`, `as.double()`, or `as.character()`


--
- **Implicit coercion** happens when you use a vector in a specific context that expects a certain type of vector


---

class: middle

# Special values

---

## Special values

- `NA`: Not available
- `NaN`: Not a number
- `Inf`: Positive infinity
- `-Inf`: Negative infinity

--

.pull-left[

``` r
pi / 0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```

``` r
0 / 0
```

```
## [1] NaN
```
]
.pull-right[

``` r
1/0 - 1/0
```

```
## [1] NaN
```

``` r
1/0 + 1/0
```

```
## [1] Inf
```
]

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;

---

## `NA`s are special ❄️s

Unlike `NaN`, `NA`s are genuinely unknown values. R uses `NA` to represent missing values in its data structures.


``` r
x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)
```


``` r
mean(x)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

``` r
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```

``` r
summary(x)
```

```
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
##    1.00    1.75    2.50    2.50    3.25    4.00       1
```

# Data classes

---

## Data classes

We talked about *types* so far, next we'll introduce the concept of *classes*

- Vectors are like Lego building blocks

--
- We stick them together to build more complicated constructs, e.g. *representations of data*

--
- The **class** attribute relates to the S3 class of an object which determines its behaviour
  - You don't need to worry about what S3 classes really mean, but you can read more about it [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3-classes) if you're curious

--
- Examples: factors, dates, and data frames
  
---

## Factors

R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values


``` r
x &lt;- factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS"))
x
```

```
## [1] BS  MS  PhD MS 
## Levels: BS MS PhD
```

--

.pull-left[

``` r
typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```
]
.pull-right[

``` r
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "factor"
```
]


---

## More on factors

We can think of factors like character (level labels) and an integer (level numbers) glued together


``` r
glimpse(x)
```

```
##  Factor w/ 3 levels "BS","MS","PhD": 1 2 3 2
```

``` r
as.integer(x)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 2
```

---

## Dates


``` r
y &lt;- as.Date("2020-01-01")
y
```

```
## [1] "2020-01-01"
```

``` r
typeof(y)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

``` r
class(y)
```

```
## [1] "Date"
```

---

## More on dates

We can think of dates like an integer (the number of days since the origin, 1 Jan 1970) and an integer (the origin) glued together


``` r
as.integer(y)
```

```
## [1] 18262
```

``` r
as.integer(y) / 365 # roughly 50 yrs
```

```
## [1] 50.03288
```

---

## Data frames

We can think of data frames like like vectors of equal length glued together


``` r
df &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
df
```

```
##   x y
## 1 1 3
## 2 2 4
```

.pull-left[

``` r
typeof(df)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```
]
.pull-right[

``` r
class(df)
```

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```
]

---

## Lists

Lists are a generic vector container; vectors of any type can go in them


``` r
l &lt;- list(
  x = 1:4,
  y = c("hi", "hello", "jello"),
  z = c(TRUE, FALSE)
)
l
```

```
## $x
## [1] 1 2 3 4
## 
## $y
## [1] "hi"    "hello" "jello"
## 
## $z
## [1]  TRUE FALSE
```

---

## Lists and data frames

- A data frame is a special list containing vectors of equal length
- When we use the `pull()` function, we extract a vector from the data frame


``` r
df
```

```
##   x y
## 1 1 3
## 2 2 4
```

``` r
df |&gt;
  pull(y)
```

```
## [1] 3 4
```

# Working with factors

## Read data in as character strings


``` r
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

```
## Rows: 60
## Columns: 3
## $ name           &lt;chr&gt; "Bernice Warren", "Woodrow Stone", "Will…
## $ number_of_cats &lt;chr&gt; "0", "0", "1", "3", "3", "2", "1", "1", …
## $ handedness     &lt;chr&gt; "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", …
```

---

## But coerce when plotting


``` r
ggplot(cat_lovers, mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

&lt;img src="10-data-importing-cleaning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png" alt="" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Use forcats to manipulate factors


``` r
cat_lovers |&gt;
* mutate(handedness = fct_infreq(handedness)) |&gt;
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

&lt;img src="10-data-importing-cleaning_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png" alt="" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

... stay for the logo
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/forcats-part-of-tidyverse.png" alt="" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-left-wide[
- Factors are useful when you have true categorical data and you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display
- They are also useful in modeling scenarios
- The **forcats** package provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors

- **lubridate** is the tidyverse-friendly package that makes dealing with dates a little easier
- It's not one of the *core* tidyverse packages, hence it's installed with `install.packages("tidyverse)` but it's not loaded with it, and needs to be explicitly loaded with `library(lubridate)`

## `read_rds()` and `write_rds()`

- CSVs can be unreliable for saving interim results if there is specific variable type information you want to hold on to.
- An alternative is RDS files, you can read and write them with `read_rds()` and `write_rds()`, respectively.


``` r
read_rds(path)
write_rds(x, path)
```

## Out and back in, take 2


``` r
write_rds(fav_food, file = "data/fav-food-clean.rds")

fav_food_clean &lt;- read_rds("data/fav-food-clean.rds")
