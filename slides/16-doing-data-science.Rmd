# What's in a data analysis?

---

## Five core activities of data analysis

1. Stating and refining the question
1. Exploring the data
1. Building formal statistical models
1. Interpreting the results
1. Communicating the results

# Reading\* makes you a better writer!

+ \*Critically engaged / intentional reading makes you a better writer

+ Start paying attention to how people communicate about data / results of an analysis 

+ As you start your project, have the end product (communication) in mind. What are the main questions you want yourself / your reader to understand at the end? 

+ What are the "threats to validity" of your data / analysis? If you were a skeptic reading your project, where would you try to poke holes? What can you do as an analyst & communicator to shore up those holes?

# Stating and refining the question

---

## Six types of questions

1. **Descriptive:** summarize a characteristic of a set of data
1. **Exploratory:** analyze to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables (hypothesis generating)
1. **Inferential:** analyze patterns, trends, or relationships in representative data from a population
1. **Predictive:** make predictions for individuals or groups of individuals
1. **Causal:** whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population
1. **Mechanistic:** explore "how" as opposed to whether

## Ex: COVID-19 and Vitamin D

1. **Descriptive:** frequency of hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in a set of data collected from a group of individuals
--

1. **Exploratory:** examine relationships between a range of dietary factors and COVID-19 hospitalisations
--

1. **Inferential:** examine whether any relationship between taking Vitamin D supplements and COVID-19 hospitalisations found in the sample hold for the population at large

--
1. **Predictive:** what types of people will take Vitamin D supplements during the next year

--
1. **Causal:** whether people with COVID-19 who were randomly assigned to take Vitamin D supplements or those who were not are hospitalised

--
1. **Mechanistic:** how increased vitamin D intake leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses

## In Groups, ....

Choose one of the following datasets we've worked with so far in this class:

+ American National Election Study (Lab 02)
+ College Majors (Lab 03)
+ Women's Soccer (Lab 04)
+ UN Votes (AE-01a)
+ Bechdel Test of movies (AE-01b)
+ Midwest - demographics, population density, poverty (AE-02)
+ NYC Flights (AE-03 and AE-04)

First, remind yourself of the observational units for the data. Then, try to come up with research questions that fit into each of the 6 categories on the previous slide (Descriptive, Exploratory, Inferential, Predictive, Causal, Mechanistic).

## Questions to ask about data science problems

- Do you have appropriate data to answer your question?
- Do you have information on confounding variables?
- Was the data you're working with collected in a way that introduces bias?

--

.question[
Suppose I want to estimate the average number of children in households in Edinburgh. I conduct a survey at an elementary school in Edinburgh and ask students at this elementary school how many children, including themselves, live in their house. Then, I take the average of the responses. Is this a biased or an unbiased estimate of the number of children in households in Edinburgh? If biased, will the value be an overestimate or underestimate?

# Exploratory data analysis

---

## Checklist


- Formulate your question
- Read in your data
- Check the dimensions - Identify the observational units and variables 
- Look at the top and the bottom of your data


- Validate with at least one external data source
- Make a plot
- Try the easy solution first

---

## Formulate your question

- Consider scope:
  - Are air pollution levels higher on the east coast than on the west coast?
  - Are hourly ozone levels on average higher in New York City than they are in Los Angeles?
  - Do counties in the eastern United States have higher ozone levels than counties in the western United States?
- Most importantly: "Do I have the right data to answer this question?"

---

## Set up project & Read in your data

- Create a new R project for your course project
- Place your data in a folder called `data`
- Create a file called `project_proposal.qmd` 
- Read your data into R with `read_csv()` or friends (`read_delim()`, `read_excel()`, etc.)

```{r}
library(readxl)
fav_food <- read_excel("data/favourite-food.xlsx")
fav_food
```

---

## `clean_names()`

If the variable names are malformatted, use `janitor::clean_names()`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(janitor)
fav_food |> clean_names()  
```




<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Communicating for your audience -->

<!-- - Avoid: Jargon, uninterpreted results, lengthy output -->
<!-- - Pay attention to: Organization, presentation, flow -->
<!-- - Don't forget about: Code style, coding best practices, meaningful commits -->
<!-- - Be open to: Suggestions, feedback, taking (calculated) risks -->

# Project requirements

Let's look at [course website](https://apumath250.netlify.app/project/#data-sources) together

---

## In your groups...

+ Set up a new R project for this course project
+ Determine how you're going to share files - Google Drive or Github (requires more set-up)
+ Review each other's P01 brainstorm post to identify topic(s) of common interest. 
    + Start by ranking the other's 3 in order of interest
    + Together decide on a top 3, with at least one from each person
+ Browse [data sources](https://apumath250.netlify.app/project/#data-sources) on course website
    + This is a good task for ChatGPT! Give it your 3 interests and ask for publically available data
+ Locate a dataset
+ Determine observational units, variables, and a research question that could be answered with that data
+ Settle on three substantially different datasets, and start working on [project proposal](https://apumath250.netlify.app/project/#project-proposal)
+ Proposal due Saturday October 5, 11:59pm
    + See course website for details - in part, will involve identifying the three Ws from Ch 2 of book

## Case study: NYC Squirrels!

- [The Squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (*Sciurus carolinensis*). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public.
- This table contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("mine-cetinkaya-rundel/nycsquirrels18")
library(nycsquirrels18)
```

---

## Locate & read the codebook / documentation

[mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/nycsquirrels18/reference/squirrels.html](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/nycsquirrels18/reference/squirrels.html)

--

## Check the dimensions 

```{r}
dim(squirrels)
```

## Identify observational units & variables

Observations are squirrel sightings (3023), have data on location & time of sighting, characteristics of squirrel & their behavior

---

## Look at the top...

```{r}
squirrels |> head()
```

---

## ...and the bottom

.small[
```{r}
squirrels |> tail()
```
]


## Validate with at least one external data source

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
squirrels |>
  select(long, lat) |>
  print(n = 15)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/central-park-coords.png")
```
]

---

## Make a plot

```{r out.width="45%"}
ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

--

.pull-left-wide[
**Hypothesis:** There will be a higher density of sightings on the perimeter than inside the park.
]

---

## Try the easy solution first

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="easy-solution", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r easy-solution, fig.show = "hide"}
squirrels <- squirrels |>
  separate(hectare, into = c("NS", "EW"), sep = 2, remove = FALSE) |>
  mutate(where = if_else(NS %in% c("01", "42") | EW %in% c("A", "I"), "perimeter", "inside")) 

ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = long, y = lat, color = where)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```
]

]

---

## Then go deeper...

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="hex-plot", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r hex-plot, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
hectare_counts <- squirrels |>
  group_by(hectare) |>
  summarise(n = n()) 

hectare_centroids <- squirrels |>
  group_by(hectare) |>
  summarise(
    centroid_x = mean(long),
    centroid_y = mean(lat)
  )

squirrels |>
  left_join(hectare_counts, by = "hectare") |>
  left_join(hectare_centroids, by = "hectare") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = centroid_x, y = centroid_y, color = n)) +
  geom_hex()
```
]

]

---

## The squirrel is staring at me!

```{r}
squirrels |>
  filter(str_detect(other_interactions, "star")) |>
  select(shift, age, other_interactions)
```
